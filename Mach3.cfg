	description = Gene Kerman wants Tudor Aerospace to develop supersonic aircraft for use by the space program. Wherner von Kerman wants to use this as an opportunity to take another step toward the development of a spaceplane, and impress Gene with another Tudor Aerospace success. Therefore,Wherner is asking your organization to attempt a supersonic test flight exceeding Mach 3 by taking an airplane above 2,500m but below 25,000m and exceeding Mach 3 safely in a level, and controlled flight. Mach Kerman has informed Tudor Aerospace that this is not going to be easy as thermal effects are expected at this speed, but everyone at Tudor Aerospace believes achieving this milestone necessary for the development of a spaceplane which will need to fly far faster than Mach 3 to be successful.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 25,000m, exceed 1029 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Mach 3 is definitely not cool. IN fact, it's the threshold of the flames of fire. The aerodynamic forces attacking your plane will be relentless, and unforgiving. Send a brave pilot who you know will keep his cool in flight.
	
	completedMessage = Incredible! You have achieved Mach 3!&br;&br;Wherner von Kerman says this flight brings the spaceplane program one crucial step toward reality, and also comes with some significant funds from the Kerbal Space Program who will benefit from your flight data.
