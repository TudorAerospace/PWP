	agent = Tudor Aerospace
	
	description = Tudor Kerman says it should be possible now to attempt an altitude record of 5,000m in an air-breathing airplane. He said Tudor Aerospace is aware that a local newspaper is offering a reward to any organization that will be the first to achieve a 5,000m flying altitude, and he thinks your organization may be up to the task.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to 5,000m, then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = Enjoy the view, as at this altitude things on the ground really start to look small!
	
	completedMessage = 5,000m and you didn't hit a bird! Great job!&br;&br;Unfortunatley, hitting a bird was what the last pilot to attempt this challenge said before he spiraled out of control from 4,500m and left a crater near the Administration Building.&br;&br;As Gene Kerman makes preparations to turn the crater into a memorial pond for aviation pioneers, both Tudor Kerman and Wherner Von Kerman congratulate you on returning safely. Wherner says Tudor Aerospace has a challenge waiting for you back at Mission Control if you're interested.
