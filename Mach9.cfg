//Contract Descriptions
	name = Mach4
	title = Achieve Mach 9!
	group = PWP
	agent = Tudor Aerospace
	
	description = Gene Kerman wants to see if Tudor Aerospace and your organization can pull off the final leg of the air speed program, and gather data for aircraft thermal effects and handling of an aircraft at hypersonic speed. What speed? Mach 9. Wherner von Kerman told Gene that Tudor Aerospace and its partners can do it. He wants you to take up this final airspeed challenge and see if you can get an aircraft to achieve Mach 9 flying above 2,500m but below 69,000m, in level flight. If it can be done, then it opens the door to hypersonic commercial flights.	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 25,000m, exceed 1372 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land and stop anywhere safely.
	
	notes = Nine times the speed of sound doesn't sound...er seem that much more than four times the speed of sound. That is, unless you're a meteor, which at some point in this mission someone on the ground might mistake you for one. Good luck!
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You have achieved Mach 9!&br;&br;Gene says that it took a whole lake to cool off your plane, and that the Kleaning Krew has a puddle of molten metal to scrape of the runway, but you did it!
