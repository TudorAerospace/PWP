	description = Taking off and landing is easy. Flying up to 2,500m with an air-breathing engine and landing back at the runway... is an entirely different matter. Tudor Kerman says runways are the roads of the future, and says your pilots might as well get used to landing on one.
	
	synopsis = Simply launch an airplane from the runway, fly up to 2,500m, then land back at the runway safely.
	
	notes = Enjoy the view!
