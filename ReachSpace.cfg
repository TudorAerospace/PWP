	description = After reaching Mach 4 and the edge of space, we started work on a prototype that can get to space, but after a Mystery Goo(tm) accident, development stopped. Gene wants you to finish and fly the prototype above the Kerman line!
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, escape the atmosphere, then land safely anywhere. Landing on the VAB is not considered safe.
	
	notes = Time to reach space, the final frontier, time to Boldly go , where no Kerbal has ever gone before....with a plane
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You have reached space!&br;&br;Gene says the Kerbal Space Program and its affiliates are serious about reaching space via a spaceplane, and will give you a great reward for reaching this goal!
