	description = After reaching Space, we started work on a prototype that can get to orbit. Unfortunately, it can only do so by using SRBs and drop tanks. Oh well, it is still a plane if it has wings, right?
	
	synopsis = Launch a shuttle from the launch pad, reach orbit, then land safely anywhere. Landing on the VAB is not considered safe.
	
	notes = Time to reach orbit, which will open up contless other opportunities!
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You have reached orbit!&br;&br;Gene says the Kerbal Space Program and its affiliates are serious about reaching orbit via a space shuttle, and will give you a great reward for reaching this goal!
