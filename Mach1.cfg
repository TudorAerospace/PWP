//Contract Descriptions
	name = Mach1
	title = Break the sound barrier!
	group = PWP
	agent = Tudor Aerospace
	
	description = Tudor Aerospace's chief scientist Mach Kerman, and KSP retired test pilot Neil Kerman, want to push Tudor Aerospace toward developing a spaceplane. But before this can happen, Wherner Von Kerman of GSP says they need to master supersonic flight, and to do this, he is asking your organization to design a plane that can break through the sound barrier in level flight under 20,000m.&br;&br;Although not required to complete this challenge, Mach Kerman believes that if you design an airplane to use one of the new liquid fueled rocket engines being developed for use by the space program, might make this attempt easier to accomplish.
	
	synopsis = Launch an airplane from the runway, fly between 2,500m and 20,000m, exceed 343 m/s in level flight for 5 seconds, and then land back at KSC safely.
	
	notes = No one has ever gone faster than the speed of sound before, so most scientists and engineers are at a loss as to give you any useful advice. Even if they could, they're afraid you'd be traveling to fast to hear it anyways.
	
	completedMessage = You have broken the sound barrier and achieved the amazing speed of Mach 1! Don't worry, we're sure it can be fixed back up in a jiffy for the next guy!
